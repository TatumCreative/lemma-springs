# Delaunay Triangulation

* [Demo](http://gregtatum.com/poems/delaunay/)

A quick sketch for me to understand what's going on with delaunay triangulation. Kudos to Mikola Lysenki's [delaunay triangulation](https://github.com/mikolalysenko/delaunay-triangulate) module and [circumcenter](https://github.com/mikolalysenko/circumcenter) module.

# Building

Requires npm and browserify to be installed. Clone or download this repo and then run `npm install` in the directory. This should install the needed modules. Then run `npm start` to automatically load up a prototyping server. To save your changes and build the results run `npm run build`.
