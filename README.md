# Spring Mesh Demo

* [Demo](http://gregtatum.com/poems/springs/)

A quick sketch for me to understand what's going on with springs on a mesh. A recent refactor moved the spring calculations into a web worker.

# Building

Requires npm and browserify to be installed. Clone or download this repo and then run `npm install` in the directory. This should install the needed modules. Then run `npm start` to automatically load up a prototyping server. To save your changes and build the results run `npm run build`.
